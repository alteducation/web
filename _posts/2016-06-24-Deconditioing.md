I'm not even sure my girls (soon to be 13 and 15) even qualify as children but i want to ask anyone who has ideas on what i could do to decondition them this far down the line? Their heads are stuffed with knowledge to pass examinations and they have nice nature because they were brought up in a home where love,truth,peace,etc are real words that still mean something and are used to help us make decisions. But they are no nearer knowing what their innate abilities are or how to make choices that will make them happy (not to be equated with successful). I don't care if they even take exams or go to college - i just want them to make good life choices but how can they when i put them on a certain path 10 years ago and that is the only way they know. Sounds like an uphill task i know but i'm certain there is a way to do this - i just have to find it.
