They follow this "kids will be kids" policy and "let them figure out their own equations" etc, he gets bullied and shoved around quite a bit by the heftier boys. But they don't do much about it. It's been going on for too long now.

There are many other things. But the people who manage the school are essentially good people. But I am not satisfied, frankly. I think the best thing is to get them out of any kind of school. Because any kind of regimen will ultimately destroy spontaneity and creativity.

I think we as parents are being cruel sometimes -- we seem to build the foundation for bad health and a dull life right from the start.
Our kids get upso early, food is shoved down so early in the morning down their throats when they haven't even woken up properly. It takes
the digestive system some time to get kicking and to shove food down 20 minutes after waking up is detrimental. Then the lunch hurriedly
gulped down because they want to go down and play. Then there's the commute -- most of them commute for a long time to get to school.
There's the heavily polluted air they are breathing in every day. My son gets back around 4.30. Because he goes by the car pool. That's a
long day.

Most parents are happy with your child's school because most people do not question anything. They live the status quo."
