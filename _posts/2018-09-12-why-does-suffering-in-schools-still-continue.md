Do you know how this system works so effectively and has been in force for almost a century or more now? It has killed millions of unsuspecting students yet the system continues its march and there are a very few who have been able to question it or break it down in order to create a new culture. We see and hear so many students committing suicides due to the pressures of the system, and yet we continue with the system as if the students suffering doesn’t matter at all. 

There’s so much pressure to learn quickly, efficiently and deliver the results flawlessly. We are almost expected to be computers, and learn as if we were a machine recording every information given to us. And, the tests given to us expect us to efficiently understand the problems within the limited period of time and solve the problems accurately. 

This is the framework that has been set up by the society, and we accept it as God’s will rather than have the guts to question it and find our own sanity about it. To be sane is to be free to understand and be clear about ourselves and the system we are caught in. 

Do you know how this system works so effectively and has been in force for almost a century or more now? It has killed millions of unsuspecting students yet the system continues its march and there are a very few who have been able to question it or break it down in order to create a new culture. We see and hear so many students committing suicides due to the pressures of the system, and yet we continue with the system as if the students suffering doesn’t matter at all. 

So, what makes this cruel system tick? Why do students and parents continue to be part of this system? This is not some system created outside of us. It is we who have created the system and who continue to maintain this system. 

So, let’s find out what really keeps this system intact for so many years? Let’s look at it unbiased, and observe what people derive from it that makes them support it. People get shocked by the tortures that happened during the Nazi regime within incarceration camps. But, no shock happens to parents regarding the schooling and education systems. 

For any system to maintain itself, there has to be something given to the stakeholders that surpasses the cruelties of the system. In the education system, this takes the form of awards, certificates, badges, positions, status and recognition. Right from kindergarten, there are innumerable forms of recognitions given to students, which in turns enhances the position of the parents, and thus blinding the parents towards the miseries ahead. 

At the end of the system, there is the recognition through the marks, grades, and ranks that act as the carrots for the students and parents to keep running after. Being poor inwardly with no happiness in life, students and parents desire for the recognition and the awards that makes them feel better and bigger. And, the system enlarges its framework of rewards thus bringing more students and parents within its fray. 

If there were no rewards as recognition at the end of the process, would this sytem be able to sustain itself? Would children and parents suffer endlessly if there was no light at the end of the tunnel? 

So, the system maintains its hold over society because of the rewards of recognition and position that it offers. An engineer, a doctor, an accountant, these are the positions that become so important, that it seems okay for society to not pay attention to the endless suffering of students within the system.
