title: My Shift To HomeSchooling
excerpt: They view school as some sort of prison sentence they have to get through - George

I have two children, both enrolled at an ICSE school in Chembur, a suburb of Bombay. My daughter is in 10th and my son in the 9th. My children are miserable. They view school as some sort of prison sentence they have to get through. Teachers who may or may not make sense and make no effort to make the material interesting. Huge loads of books that have to be humped up and down five floors. Piles of homework and two weekly tests that you had better do well at. Or else.

Neither my wife nor I have pushed them to top the class. We believe there is a lot more to life than marks given for rote learning. My children read voraciously, watch films that their peer group would not understand and are able to conduct themselves with intelligence and humour. We have considered homeschooling for a while now. There is a lot of arguments in favour – the children can learn at their own pace, learn what they need to and set their own goals. And then there are the thoughts that have stopped us thus far…

1. The children are in their final years of school. Is this a good time to switch?

2. Homeschooling requires immense commitments of time and effort from at least one if not both parents. I make television commercials and my wife handles the production design of my films while working with her own clients as a graphic designer. Our hours are very irregular. For instance, I have spent the last week at the office, working all day and editing nights.

3. Like it or not, there is a stigma attached to the National Open School system. As far as my children's teachers and peer group are concerned, the NIOS is meant for dull laggards who cannot cope with the normal school system.

My children are not dull. When interested in the subject they can effortlessly top the class – and do so very often in English. When uninterested, as they are most of the time, their marks are in single digits. Consequently, the teachers believe they are malingering and berate them and threaten my son in particular with expulsion.

We have had enough. After considerable soul-searching, my wife and I have decided to remove them from their school immediately.

I do not know where we are to go from here. Home-schooling? Another school? Boarding school?"

Our children left school – hopefully, for good the day India celebrated its 60th year of Independence.

My daughter was in the first few months of her 10th Std (ICSE) my son was a year behind her. My children have been in the same school (St. Gregorios – ICSE) since kindergarten. When we informed their principal of our decision, she barely heard us out, said "Whatever.." and asked us to process our papers with the clerk. So much for caring. Suddenly, our rather controversial decision looked like a very good one.

NIOS has the (perhaps unjustified) image of being the choice of weak students. What mattered more is that the examination was a state board one (SSC) and would need plenty of learning by rote – which is precisely what had turned my children off their studies in school. 

IGCSE has been a breath of fresh air. We took an initial trip to New Bombay to look at the textbooks. They are written with intelligence and care. The children have picked their own subjects and we have acquired most of the texts. The books make me feel like going back to school. 

The children are committed to four hours of study a day, no less, more if they want it. They end up doing at least that much, often more. Squabbling is down, discussions are up. My son chuckles with enjoyment as he reads 'As You Like It' in two sittings. He finishes another prescribed text – Lord of the Flies – and we have a long late night telephonic discussion about the behavior of the boys in the book. Not once do any of us wonder about the questions that might be asked in the forthcoming examination. 

My daughter does four straight hours of history and can barely pull herself away. She finds business studies fascinating. I tell her a dormant Sindhi gene has surfaced. She watches Arthur Miller's "Crucible" and weeps unashamedly at the end. They argue over who gets first shot at 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. 

We are in hunt of knowledge. There are deep veins of gold in this mine. 

We have no tutors in place. We do not know how we will manage schedules on a long-term basis. The future is a vast and trackless void. But every time we see the kids study; it fills us with great optimism.
