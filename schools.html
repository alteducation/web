                              <p>At the core of Bhavya’s philosophy lies the conviction that given the freedom to be what we naturally are, we, and especially our children, become astoundingly creative and inventive. We can then use what we have created and learned, to lead more meaningful lives. We have created such an environment by choosing to free our children of the restrictions imposed by classrooms, timetables, competitions, examinations, grades, and a fixed curriculum/structure. This freedom enables each child to learn and grow at his own pace and, in the course of time, identify and develop his interests as well as his inherent talents, thus creating independent, self-directed learners for life.</p>

                              <p>Over two hundred years of the Industrial Revolution has filled the world with things for our convenience and safety.
                                 but it has also made people undervalue their potential for a fulfilling life and has polluted the land, water and air.
                                 Prakriya is a school that is committed to go beyond factory schooling which dehumanises us and alienates us from the earth that supports life.
                                 We are focussed on discovering meaningful ways of working with children and share our learning about ecological education with others through our sister organisations,
                                 Bhoomi Network and Prakriya Educator and Institution Development Centre. Our children are the leaders and citizens who will face the crisis of climate change
                                 and its consequences tomorrow... hence focusing on education that awakens us to theses realities is essential today.

                                 One learns to look at the whole of man's endeavor, his search for beauty, his search for truth and a way of living that is not a contradiction between conclusion and action.It is a place where both teacher
                                 and the taught learn a way of life in which conflict ends.It is the concern of these schools to bring about a new generation of human beings who are free from self-centered action,
                                 to bring about a mind that has no conflict within itself and so end the struggle and conflict in the world about us.

                              <p>Regular schools consider all children as machines with equal learning efficiency, who can learn a predetermined textual content within a stipulated period of time,
                                 in a predetermined way. If all children learn this way there is no problem. What is the future of the children who cannot learn this way? There is only a film (Tare Zameen Par),
                                 for dyslexic children, but no school. We find many mentally normal children who cannot adjust to the strict regimen of regular schools. We call them OUT OF SYSTEM children.
                                 So we are running a free child-centric school for such children We felt, we cannot create another earth and it was our duty to save this. So, we made Kalilyuva Mane completely
                                 an eco conscious school.

                                 more solutions were sought. Today we have a diverse array of time -tested sustainable solutions for the common man.This includes watershed management, natural farming, low cost construction,

                              <p>Children are encouraged to speak in Malayalam which, if you remember is our mother tongue. We have found that using Malayalam as the medium of instruction in lower classes leads to a significant
                                 increase in self-confidence and stimulates imagination. Once they have a proper grounding in their own language and culture, then learning English is no longer a dreaded chore.
                                 The children sing old Malayalam ‘Tharattu’ which were re-discovered and resurrected from cold storage. We also teach Carnatic Music. In the Nursery Class and Stds. I to IV, instruction is completely informal.
                                 Little pupils sit on the ground in groups, and a single class can tackle three different subjects simultaneously. Teachers move from one group to another encouraging self learning and experiment.

                              <p>Aksharnandan was started in Pune in 1992 by a group of people as reaction to the educational system in place that focused so much on competition and exam oriented rote-learning. The people in this group believed that education is the process to actualize their vision of a society and an individual in this society.
                                 It is a Government Recognized non-aided school from K.G. to X with just 40 students in each class with no divisions. The school has consciously accepted the formal framework of State Board Examination (S.S.C.) and follows the curriculum recommended by the Government.
                                 However within this framework Aksharnandan has adopted innovative practices to make the curriculum relevant and linked to actual life. It strongly believes that real education is that which connects the children to the society.

                              <p>We are not a model to be emulated. We believe that every one has their own destiny and path
                                 to travel and ‘unknown’ to unravel. We also do not claim that we know what to do. We know
                                 almost what we should not do. Schooling , controlling or conditioning are against the very
                                 foundation of living and that is what modern schools have been doing in the name of education.
                                 To educate is to draw out. Instead we have been filling in! We have come a long way and confused
                                 ourselves so badly that now to trace back and understand is a herculean task.In fact from human
                                 beings we have become human knowings! Knowing happens in the realm of unknown.
                                 Unknown is the condition for awe, humility, creativity, spontaneity, sensitivity and hence where
                                 living can happen. So we invite any one who wants explore afresh the whole question of being,
                                 learning, beauty, children etc. to be part of this journey.

                                 This whole movement of enquiry into knowledge, into oneself, into the possibility of something beyond knowledge, brings about naturally a psychological revolution, and from this comes inevitably
                                 a totally different order in human relationship, which is society. The intelligent understanding of all this can bring about a profound change in the consciousness of mankind.

                                 but it is clear that emotional stability, intellectual flexibility, sound judgement and genuine independence will be qualities vital for their future.Our aim thus, is to provide all our children with a well
                                 rounded education which will guide them to find their own path in life. An education that will not only equip them with skills and knowledge but also make them inwardly free, secure and creative adults.
                                 It shall always be our endeavour to prepare the students to enter adulthood with self - discipline, social awareness, wonder and reverence for the world.

                              <p>Digantar’s search for alternatives in education began on a very small scale with a small school in 1978. The teachers of this school had trained under the late Shri David Horsburgh, who also guided the school in its initial years.
                                 The first ten years of that small school were a good grounding in understanding elementary education in general and classroom practices in particular. Digantar felt that it is the rural children who continued to be deprived of good education. We therefore began to focus on rural children.
                                 Digantar feels that the aim of education should be to develop rational autonomy, sensitivity, democratic and egalitarian values, dignity of labour and skills. We believe that the purpose of primary education is to make the child a self-motivated and independent learner.

No more industrial education – we’re demonstrating how even in the most rural and deprived areas education can be exceptional.We achieve this by looking at what’s best for children as children, and by listening to the community; they understand far better that we do what life is like there, what the challenges are, and what they want for their children. Many of our teachers are also from the local village – we believe very strongly in motivating change from within – giving them a special insight to the barriers that stop children coming to school.</p>

                              <p>Every child, without exception, has an innate and unquenchable thirst to understand the world in which he lives and to gain freedom and competence in it. Whatever truly adds to his understanding,
                                 his capacity for growth and pleasure, his powers, his sense of his own freedom, dignity and worth, may be said to be true education.
                                 In fact, learning is the human activity which least needs manipulation by others. Most learning is not the result of instruction. It is the result of unhampered participation in life in a meaningful setting.
                                 Holistic education is a philosophy of education based on the premise that each person finds identity, meaning, and purpose in life through self -learning and through connections to the community and the natural world.

                              <p>Uday is born out of the need to have a school that provides wholesome education in Jaipur, to address the needs of a growing child and fulfil the real role of education  which is not just to develop
                                 the intellect but also feelings (emotions, asthetics, social sensitivity) & will power (the ability to get things started and completed).Uday considers these as essential in achieving a preparation for
                                 life in the “real” world.Uday is based on Waldorf pedagogy which offers a true, tested education.

                                 <p>Enabling children to explore whatever they wish can be both exhilarating and frightening for students and parents. For some it gives a chance to explore what they have been seeking for a long time;
                                    for others, there is a great challenge as they are called on to identify things they would like to explore and to pursue them with vigour and excellence – without the false motivation of reward and punishment.
                                    Such challenges are part of the learning opportunity because they give a chance to explore with students what they really wish to engage with –
                                    something they have often not considered before because they have been told what they will be taught..

                                    It is a school for those who understand that competition does not lead to excellence; it only breeds anxieties, fears and hatred. It is a school for those who understand that learning happens in a state of relationship –
                                    along with higher order thinking. It is for those who cherish the intrinsic value of learning and do not see it as a means to an end- the end being a secure job and other
                                    possessions that accompany.

                                    Our School is based on Sri Aurobindo's and the Mother's Free-Progress education where the whole emphasis is on free growth and natural development.
                                    We are organizing a program for students from the age of 7 to14 years in which they learn in progressive stages to make full use of the Free Progress approach.
                                    We would prefer to keep the children in small groups or batches of about 5 to 8, for greater intensity.

                                 <p>Our social structures have created extremely complicated survival processes. A child’s ability to look at life with utter freshness and involvement is slowly disappearing.
                                    It is the duty and responsibility of our educational systems to bring that back. Education can never be a profession – it must be a passion. In the process of education,
                                    it is very important to see that the child does not lose his joyfulness, his spontaneity, or his ability to be truthful without any fear of consequence. At the Home School,
                                    we are striving to create the necessary platform where education is not about loading the child’s mind with information,
                                    but about making the child’s mind capable of razor sharp perception, capable of knowing life in its full depth and dimension.

                                 <p>Our endeavor at Marudam Farm School is to explore, through the process of education, if one can meet the needs of the individual child and also bring "learning" as close as possible
                                    to "living". We hope to create a learning space that allows for the flowering of a deep sense of joy, sensitivity, order and intelligence as well as an innate sense of well-being in a child.
                                    In Marudam we see both teachers and students as learners sharing a learning space. As such, the teacher is seen more as a facilitator. Together, we take responsibility and care for the
                                    school environment.

                                 <p>Sholai School is the brainchild of Brian Jenkins, a British social anthropologist. Jenkins first came to India in 1969, to study at Bodhgaya. Inspired by J. Krishnamurthy, the great thinker and teacher,
                                    Jenkins does not believe in the existing hierarchical system of schools. Students from different classes and age groups are clubbed together for learning opportunities. He believes that learning ceases in classrooms –
                                    practical knowledge is out there in the field.

                                    vertically grouped classes; no reward and punishment system used as an educational device; living in co-operation rather than in competition; participation in community life and intelligent, informal and personal
                                    relationship between teacher and taught and an emphasis on a correct relationship with one’s physical and social environment.

                                 <p>Students learn all regular subjects through school. The school sees that all subjects are essentially interrelated and that the division of knowledge into subjects serves reasons of practicality.
                                    In learning each student must begin from where he or she is and not conform to a standard expectation; and it is for the teacher to nurture this growth in learning. All learning at school attempts to build
                                    the student's understanding of the subject and its relation to life.

                                    The girls are quite confident and stand up to ask questions and make comments on aspects of the discussions that concern them.

                                    Prakriti has been founded with the conviction that if children learn to understand themselves, be completely aware of their swabhav, discover their prakriti, the true meaning of life will unfold itself.

                                 <p>Vidyashram’s primary focus is to make learning relevant and meaningful, in line with their belief that teachers and books are not the only source of knowledge and there is a need to understand multiple perspectives.
                                    In practice, this translates into students making connections between theory and practice, really understanding and taking ownership of their learning, and in natural interdisciplinary connections in assignments.
                                    For instance, in one class 4th graders created individual surveys, conducted the survey in their own school and then presented the findings in the form of bar graphs, pie charts etc instead of simply ‘seeing’
                                    how to present data in a textbook. In another example, the curriculum has fully integrated arts as a way to enhance learning and making it more fun, personal, and experiential.
